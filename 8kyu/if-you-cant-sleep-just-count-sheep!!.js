//My Solution

function countSheep(n){
   let str = ""
    for( let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
      str += `${i} sheep...`}
    return str;
  }


  //variable to hold the string is declared and assigned
  //for loop is run however many times the input says to
   //every time the loop runs, it concatinates the following string into the variable 
   //variable is returned
